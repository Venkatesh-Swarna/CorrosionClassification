# CorrosionClassification

Corrosion poses a significant threat to various industries, including infrastructure, automotive, and
maritime sectors. It undermines the structural integrity of materials, leading to substantial economic
losses and safety risks. Timely and accurate detection of corrosion types is essential for implementing
preventive maintenance and effective mitigation strategies. This report outlines the development of a
corrosion classification system utilizing YOLOv5x, focusing on three primary corrosion types: Crevice
Corrosion, Filiform Corrosion, and Uniform Corrosion. The system employs advanced deep learning
techniques to identify and classify these corrosion types within industrial images, thereby facilitating
proactive maintenance measures


In this CorrosionClassification project, we as a team developed a machine learning model to classify different types of corrosion, enhancing predictive maintenance strategies and utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks, achieving high accuracy in corrosion detection. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including normalization and image resizing, to optimize model performance. We also applied data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization capabilities. Additionally, leveraged transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained models, which expedited the training process and enhanced accuracy.

To fine-tune the model, we conducted hyperparameter tuning, optimizing various parameters to achieve better classification performance. The model's effectiveness was evaluated using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also implemented visualization techniques using Matplotlib to track training progress and interpret model behavior effectively. The project was well-documented with clear instructions for replication and further development.
