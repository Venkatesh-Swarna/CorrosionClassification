# CorrosionClassification

Corrosion poses a significant threat to various industries, including infrastructure, automotive, and
maritime sectors. It undermines the structural integrity of materials, leading to substantial economic
losses and safety risks. Timely and accurate detection of corrosion types is essential for implementing
preventive maintenance and effective mitigation strategies. This report outlines the development of a
corrosion classification system utilizing YOLOv5x, focusing on three primary corrosion types: Crevice
Corrosion, Filiform Corrosion, and Uniform Corrosion. The system employs advanced deep learning
techniques to identify and classify these corrosion types within industrial images, thereby facilitating
proactive maintenance measures
